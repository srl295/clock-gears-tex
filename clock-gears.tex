\section{Intro}

I have a son who loves gears and clocks.  I work on date and time stuff. Someday, I hope we can build a clock together. In the mean time,
I've done some calculations on what the clock gears should look like. For a great reference on date and time, see \citation{calendrical}.

\section{Calculation}

\subsection{Basic Day Math}

There are 60 seconds in a minute.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, thus, 3,600 seconds in an hour.

There are 12 hours in half a day, or 24 hours in a full day.
There are 43,200 seconds in half a day, or 86,400 seconds in a full day.
There are 720 minutes in half a day, or 1,440 minutes in a full day.

\subsection{Between hands}

The second hand turns around once per minute. As there are 60 seconds in a minute, the second hand turns \( \frac{ \ang{360} }{60} = \ang{6} \)  per second.

The minute hand turns around once per hour. As there are 60 minutes in an hour, the minute hand turns  \( \frac{ \ang{360} }{60} = \ang{6} \)  per minute or 
  \( \frac{ \ang{360} }{3600} = \ang{0.1} = \ang{0;6;0} \) per second. 

The hour hand turns around once per half-day. As there are 12 hours in a half-day, the minute hand turns
 \( \frac{ \ang{360} }{12} = \ang{30} \)  per hour. 
 
 \subsection{Gearing}
 
 The gearing between Second and Minute hand is 60:1 that is 60 minutes per hour.
 
 The gearing between Minute and Hour hand is \( (60*12):1 = 720:1 \) that is 720 minutes in 12 hours.
